### CyberToolBank.cc Shut Down?

If you go their [website](https://cybertoolbank.cc), It will say "Proxy Error: The proxy server could not handle the request. Reason: Error during SSL Handshake with remote server. Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. Their [Tor Hidden Service](http://2snjjrtrlvjqbbex4yzz6fbwdm3o6dwatciruyuqgtk3bdxhzk4ridad.onion/) is also down, So if they are making a new website or just took everything offline and going to live in the real world now that's fine, they should of open-source everything. But it's fine this is why people like else love keeping shit alive and helping people with tutorials and opsec.

### New Domain & Open-Source
I will find a affordable great domain name and leave the source code open source so people can spread it and contribute to it with pull request for finding new ways of protecting your data during these hard times we are facing right now.
